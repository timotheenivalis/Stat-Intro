I like to emphasise that the subject of modern statistics (ie analysis of variance, p-values, etc) is only around 100 years old, The subject was largely developed in the UK at Rothamstead Station, a centre for agricultural research. 

I think it's important to mention that statistics as an academic subject was developed to understand and interpret data from field experiments. Even though Fisher and his colleagues had strong backgrounds in mathematics, statistics grew out of the application of mathematics to experimental work. (100 years later, the subject of statistics has moved beyond its biological applications, and biologists and statisticians are rarely seen together. )

Fisher made a number of major contributions to the field of modern statistics, and this course is largely based upon two of these contributions:
- he invented Analysis of Variance. He demonstrated how one can partition the observed variation in an outcome variable into variation due to different factors in the experiment; factors of interest as well as nuisance factors. He demonstrates how one can use this partition to attribute association (causation); ie to argue with confidence that an experimental factor of interest influences the response. 
-he codified principles of experimental design in a 1925 book called Principles of ... (the title is on my slide). This is a hugely important book that should be widely read by all experimentalists. Unfortunately Fisher was not a lucid writer, so whilst the ideas are great, they are poorly communicated. 

I think sometime later in the course I mention that factorial experiments were an idea of Fisher's. Prior to Fisher, the research scientists would run experiments 1 factor at a time. For example, if they were interested in optimising nitrogen and and phosphorus applications, they would run separate experiments for each chemical. Fisher wrote convincingly that it is much more efficient to ask several questions at a time within a single experiment; indeed, nature herself would never take a 1 factor at a time approach.
